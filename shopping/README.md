# Shopping

An AI that predicts whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase. 
Using given information about how many pages a user visited, whether or not they shop 
on a weekend, what browser they're using, etc., a nearest-neighbor classifier is trained.
There is data from about 12,000 user sessions and the model is not perfectly accurate.
