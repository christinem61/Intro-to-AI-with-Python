# Nim

An AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning. Q-learning
is used meaning that for every good action there is a reward of 1 and for every 
action that leads to losing the game there is a reward of -1. The 'train' function
trains the AI by running n simulated games against itself and returning the fully
trained AI, so that the human can now play against it.
